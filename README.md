## Problem Statement

The goal of this project was to analyze a dataset of learner feedback tickets to identify data quality issues, uncover high-impact strategic patterns, and propose a robust monitoring framework. The analysis needed to go beyond surface-level metrics to pinpoint the most critical issues affecting learner satisfaction and suggest concrete process improvements.

## Key Features & Analysis

This dashboard is built around the three core tasks of the assignment, providing a comprehensive solution.

### 1. Data Quality & Validation
* **Automated Audit:** The **"Data Quality Checks"** tab identifies and displays critical data issues, including missing values, duplicate tickets, logical inconsistencies between status/sub-status, and impossible timelines (e.g., tickets resolved before creation).
* **Actionable Recommendations:** For each identified issue, clear and specific **process improvement recommendations** are provided to prevent future data corruption at the source.

### 2. Strategic Pattern Analysis
* **Prioritization Matrix:** The **"Overview"** tab features a powerful "Strategic Issue Prioritisation" table that ranks issues not just by **frequency** (ticket volume) but also by **impact** (average NPS and resolution time).
* **"Single Biggest Fix":** Based on the prioritization matrix, the dashboard explicitly identifies and recommends the **single most impactful issue** to address for the greatest improvement in learner satisfaction.
* **Performance Tracking:** The dashboard includes dedicated tabs for analyzing **team performance**, visualizing **SLA breaches**, and understanding the **ticket flow** with an interactive Sankey diagram.

### 3. Monitoring & Automation
* **Root Cause Analysis:** The **"Root Cause Analysis"** tab uses a word cloud to quickly identify common themes within ticket remarks, allowing for a high-level understanding of learner complaints.
* **Automation Suggestions:** The project includes practical suggestions and a Python code example for **process automation**, such as auto-tagging tickets based on remark content to improve efficiency.
